### Choice of Recommender System

I had 3 choices of recommender system

1. Content Based - Recommends products based on Product Similarity
2. Collaborative Filtering - Recommends products based on User Preferences Similarities
3. Reinforcement Learning - Recommends product by going through purchase history of user by exploration and exploitation of different item recommendations and develops its learning.

Based on the given problem statement, we need to see user's preference / product and recommend similar products.

So the most suitable one here would be <b>Content Based Recommender system</b>
